# My Resume

This repo contains the source code of the resume that I submitted for SPO Internships 2020.

The master resume uses the [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template.  
The one-page resume uses [yashsriv's resume template](https://github.com/yashsriv/resume/).

To compile:

```shell
xelatex one-page-resume.tex
```

or 

```shell
xelatex master-resume.tex
```
